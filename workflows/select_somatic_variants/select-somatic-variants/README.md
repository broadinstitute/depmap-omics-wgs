# Annotate mutations postprocessing

This module loads the DuckDB database generated by [vcf-to-duckdb](https://github.com/broadinstitute/vcf-to-duckdb) and exports a single Parquet file representing a MAF file. This file contains only the filtered somatic variants and only the columns needed by the [postprocessing function](https://github.com/broadinstitute/depmap_omics/blob/master/depmapomics/mutations.py#L440) in depmap-omics.

We maintain [a mapping of VCF fields to output column names](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12DKcckII0i_g1yKbPmVmAstXYZ93Y6kexlIOQJP2DLY/edit?usp=sharing).
